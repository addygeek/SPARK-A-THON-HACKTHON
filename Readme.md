## Development Approach
### User-Centered Design
We conducted extensive user research to identify customer pain points and preferences, which informed the design of our solution. Our focus is on creating an intuitive and seamless experience that enhances both online and in-store shopping.

### Agile Methodology
We employed Agile development practices, allowing us to build and refine our solution iteratively. This approach helped us quickly respond to user feedback and improve the product in real-time.

### Integration and Testing
We ensured that all systems—whether online, in-store, or mobile—are well-integrated, and conducted thorough testing to identify and resolve any issues. Automated testing tools like Selenium and Cypress were used to test the web application, while unit testing frameworks like Jest were used for back-end testing.
